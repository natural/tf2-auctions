		<h3 class="mt2">Q:  Is it safe?  A:  Yes, it's safe.</h3>

		    You don't log into this site directly, you log into the Steam Community at
		    <a class="nice" target="_new"
		    href="https://steamcommunity.com">steamcommunity.com</a>.
		    That's a Valve web server.  That's where you enter
		    your username and password.  You never, ever enter
		    your username and password on this site.  Click
		    the login link to see for yourself.  If you're
		    using a modern web browser, you'll notice that the
		    login page is secure.  Nifty, huh?
		</p>

		<h3 class="mt2">Q:  No, really, is it safe?  A:  Yes, really, it's safe.</h3>
		<p class="mt05">
		    When you enter your username and password on
		    <a class="nice" target="_new" href="https://steamcommunity.com">steamcommunity.com</a>,
		    only that site gets it.  We use a technology
		    called <a class="nice" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> 
		    to communicate with the Valve servers.  Those
		    Valve servers tell us your Steam ID and that
		    you're cool, and that's all.  No passwords, no emails, nothin.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mt2">But I don't think it's safe cause my bro said sometimes the intertubes eat computers and stuff.</h3>
		<p class="mt05">
		    Yeah, I heard that, too.  But you don't have to
		    trust me, you believe whatever you want, bra.  If you're not gonna log in here,
		    you might like <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=trollface">some cool pictures</a>.
