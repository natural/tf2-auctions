    <h1 class="mt2"><span class="hilite">&nbsp;</span>The Open Market for TF2 Items</h1>

    <div>
	<p>
	    This site allows you to buy, sell, and auction your TF2
	    items for money.  We do this because:
        <ul class="ml1">
	    <li>There is nothing illegal about it.  By definition, it
	    is not a black market, but an open market.</li>

	    <li>It is against the recommendations of Valve Software,
	    creators of TF2, but Valve has not forbidden it.  Because
	    Valve has not forbidden this kind of transaction, <em>it
	    is bound to happen</em>.</li>

	    <li>Because it is bound to happen, it is better to do it
	    <em>in the open</em> where others can watch, and where
	    scammers can be identified, avoided, and ultimately
	    bannished from the community.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    </div>

    <div>
	<h1 class="mt2"><span class="hilite">&nbsp;</span>Who should I trust?</h1>

	<p>Remember:  if it seems too good to be true, it probably is! Other things to keep in mind:
	<ul class="ml1">
	    <li>Look at the feedback of a seller or trader.  Have they
	    completed successful trades in the past?  Have they bought
	    or sold items to a variety of players?</li>

	    <li>Use a trusted middle man if you're not sure.  Doing so
	    is beyond the scope of this document (and this site), but
	    they're not hard to find.</li>

	    <li>When in doubt, back right out.  If you're not
	    comfortable, just don't do it.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    </div>


    <div>
	<h1 class="mt2"><span class="hilite">&nbsp;</span>Who will help me if I get scammed?</h1>

	<p>Sadly, no one. You're taking a risk.  Sometimes that risk
	is small, sometimes it is not, but it is always there and it
	is always yours.  If you're not sure, don't buy, sell, or trade!
